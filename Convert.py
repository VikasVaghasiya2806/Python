# Convert from int to float:
x = float(1)   # 1 becomes 1.0

# Convert from float to int:
y = int(2.8)   # 2.8 becomes 2 (decimal part is removed)

# Convert from int to complex:
z = complex(1) # 1 becomes (1+0j), a complex number

# Print the converted values
print(x)       # 1.0
print(y)       # 2
print(z)       # (1+0j)

# Print the data types of each variable
print(type(x)) # <class 'float'>
print(type(y)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(z)) # <class 'complex'>
